# Pitch

## Problem

Solana is a high speed blockchain network which requires fast, stable validator nodes, with high decentralisation across the data centers in the world.
There are currently about 2200 validators on the Testnet and about 670 on the Mainnet. The majority of them are set up using various guides and information available on the Internet. 
These are ad-hoc, unique installations with different software versions, settings, configurations and user profiles.
Many people running validator nodes have little to zero knowledge about system administration, troubleshooting and monitoring.
High (knowledge) entry barrier attracts people to start their nodes only in a small count of data centers mentioned in guides and YouTube videos.
These facts lead to less cluster performance, stability, resilience and decentralisation. On the other hand, it is hard to impossible to provide any support in case of a validator's failures or bad performance.

## Solution

The toolkit, allowing to set up a validator node and monitoring in one-click manner with consistent common settings for everyone by providing an interactive shell script.

The Infrastructure-As-A-Code with ansible pack for experienced users to use as references and best practice documents.

It is possible to install a monitoring part only by using a shell script.

The experienced team stands behind the project for further development, and for multilingual user support.

Solution Features:
- Node bootstrapping
- Solana version upgrade
- Various node and cluster monitoring dashboards
- Disaster recovery
- Alerts (via Telegram bot and other channels)
- Mobile cockpit for alerts, notifications, and node control on the go
- Open API to monitoring data

Our solution increases network decentralization through a lowered barrier to entry: the toolkit enables a much larger audience to set up and run a validator node with
higher efficiency and resiliency of the network

With our SV (Solana Validator) Manager (https://sv-manager.thevalidators.io/) we currently implemented a minimum viable product (MVP) which is actively used by at least 40 validators.

## Competition

- Setup: Various guidelines offered on GitHub, YouTube, a number of blogs.
- Monitoring: validators.app, stakeconomy
- *Nobody provides a full package from one hand.*

## Amount

Depending on the available funding, we would be able to dedicate a varying amount of our time to this project. Better funding means we would be able to fully achieve the goals listed above and do it faster, while also offering more support for the Solana Validator community.

We see the SV-Manager as a long-term project that needs to be constantly developed and enhanced together with Solana, and we see its future as being most successful in close cooperation with the Solana Foundation
